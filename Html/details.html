			<h1>The Most Expensive Car In Carlos Sainz's Collection</h1>

					The Formula 1 circle refers to Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz Jr. as the
					"matador from Madrid." Born Carlos Sainz Vazquez de Castro on
					September 1, 1994 (via Formula 1), Sainz Jr. is the son of two-time
					World Rally Champion Carlos Sainz Sr., a man who struck fear in the
					hearts of professional rally drivers in the early '90s. AutoSport
					reports that the younger Sainz earned his F1 stripes after winning the
					Formula Renault 3.5 championship in 2014 as a member of the Red Bull
					junior racing program. He made his maiden F1 debut with Scuderia Toro
					Rosso in 2015 alongside Max Verstappen, who is now a two-time Formula
					1 World Champion.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					But unlike Verstappen and other F1 drivers who habitually amass a
					drool-worthy car collection, the Spaniard's more modest garage
					reflects Sainz Jr.'s relaxed demeanor and instinctive passion for
					speed. In a report by Style, Sainz Jr. said at a press conference for
					the 2016 Hungarian Grand Prix that he still drives around town in a
					Volkswagen Golf GTI. Hot Cars adds the VW was a gift from Sainz Jr.'s
					parents for his 18th birthday, a perfect gift for a hot-blooded teen
					driver and a car that any 18-year-old wouldn't mind driving.

				<h1>From VWs to supercars</h1>
				<img src="/img/car.webp" alt="cars" />
				<p>
					Carlos Sainz Jr. moved to Renault in 2018 and joined McLaren in 2019
					to pair with Lando Norris. Unsurprisingly, his time with McLaren made
					him rethink the VW as a primary set of wheels. In its place, he added
					a $300,000+ McLaren 720S and a $250,000 600LT Spider to his garage.
					However, Sainz Jr. then moved to Ferrari near the end of 2020 and
					added several prancing horse badges to the growing collection. He
					acquired an exquisite Ferrari Roma immediately after donning the
					Tifosi colors — a $250,000 Grand Tourer with a 611-horsepower
					turbocharged V8 under the hood.

						A lot goes into developing a car, especially when it comes to the
						luxury high-performance segment. Because the automotive market is
						highly competitive, especially when it comes to the top-tier
						contestants, manufacturers are in a constant race to innovate beyond
						what they've done before and release only the best of what they come
						up with. Each top car manufacturer spends millions of dollars on
						R&D, the high-quality materials used, and on developing the
						innovative features that make their models capable of high
						performance. Each of these factors shoots up the final price of the
						vehicle.
					</p>
					<p>
						While luxurious sports cars and hypercars are meant to give the best
						driving experience, one has to pay the price for the same, and
						sometimes the amount can be as ridiculous as $18 million. Although
						most of us can't even think of affording such hefty price tags, we
						can still have some fun exploring these high-performance rides. Here
						are the 15 most expensive cars of all time
